A new immigrant, a fresh graduate, a veteran researcher. Hello World! My name is Xiaoqin Zhang.
I am lucky to be one of the Millennials who witness the rise of AI power and data-driven innovation.
After years of academic training, I gradually shift my passion to data science industry.
I am fascinated with the beauty of data visualization and the magic of Big Data. With so many
learning resources, from MOOCs and Kaggle competition, to numerous blogs and
YouTube videos, my skill sets are increasing almost every day, every hour. My strong academic background
and various personal projects experience only make me firmly believe: after all, human learning beats machine
learning, no matter what.

Some of the highlights:
* Proficiency in Python and MySQL
* Machine Learning modeling and project experience
* Data collection, processing and visualization
* Hands-on experience of Apache Hive and Hadoop
* Knowledge about GCP and AWS, a practitioner
* Entry level Switch and Flask developer skill
